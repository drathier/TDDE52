# zephyr
- zephyr docs are huge
- tried to setup on work laptop, without much luck, doesn't want to use docker because too many vm layers and don't want to write docker file, so retrying next week on freshly installed ubuntu

# et purs
- compiled the project
- felt great
- lack of docs
- looking at previous PR's fixing error messages
- 

# fh purs
- good idea to try to find the smallest thing that could be merged
- "sounds more like a masters thesis project", should try to cut down scope where feasible
- 

# em purs
- looked at type class derivation
- generic type class instances might be preferred over built-in derivations?
