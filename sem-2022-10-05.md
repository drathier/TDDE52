# zephyr
- not a lot of progress, caught up in another project
- looked at some issues but couldn't reproduce in emulator without hardware
- looking at micropython-zaphire, should be able to run that
- jokingly complains that you can't do everything when there's an OS in the way :)

# et purs
- wants to diff row type error messages, as soon as the Erl.Data.Map thing is merged

# fh purs
- side-quest is blocked on bike shedding; one breaking change turned into "let's break all the things"
- got type alias tracking implemented
- offering to help em find a good task, em agrees

# em purs
- got PR merged in re some error message, not sure if trivial change or not
- not that sure what to do


# info
