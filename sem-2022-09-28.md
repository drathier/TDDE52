# zephyr
- zephyr docs are huge, tried to read the relevant parts
- most bugs are reported jit and fixed by the reporter, so hard to find things to work on
- no hardware until end of october, so setting up qemu
- might not be any issues available, things are pretty mature
- looked at some related tools, they're also quite mature
- might switch to micro python?
-
