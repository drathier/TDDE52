mid-term review
- are we on track for the target grade?


# hanna:
- switched projects, making examples for uavcan
- making smaller intro-examples now
- project plan is updated
- issue: "can we get examples?", basically issueless
- planning approach: out the window

# purs:
- tech diff: hard af, with some medium parts
- tests: undocumented, basically, but lots of tests
- 

# et purs
- nagging at people on chat to get changes merged

# em purs
- trying to find something to work on

# hs zephyr
- detour of tasks
- nothing in the current version of zephyr that's available to work on
- looking at kan protocol impl, uavcan/ciphel protocol on top of kan, would like to get it running on zephyr
  - need msg layer and transport layer
  - (sounds quote hard?)
  - looked for minimal example, there are never any minimal examples
  - found issue of someone else trying this, but they got stuck too
  - looking into creating minimal examples for ciphel
    - e.g. heartbeat pub/sub
  - tools themselves for creating minimal examples are hard af
  - ciphel is recently 1.0, but still changing quite much
  - talked to maintainers to see what to do

# fh purs
- side-quest and main quests are still both blocked, but some progress has been made, bumped compiler FE+BE and work code base to newest purs versions, but got stuck on a purerl (BE) bug in code generation https://github.com/purerl/purerl/issues/30 and https://github.com/purescript/purescript/issues/4338#issuecomment-1270275678
- got response from person responsible for the part I got stuck on
- we reproduced the bug on 0.15.5, but it works on 0.15.4
